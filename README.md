I really enjoy [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brainfuck). It simulates DNA pretty well considering its very small lexicon of 8 symbols.

1. `bf.php` runs a specified bf program with the provided input and produces a JSON description of its output, the time and number of steps it took to run the program
2. `flower.js` describes a function to produce random input and the desired output of a bf program, as well as a fitness test to rank candidates
3. `bf.html` is an HTML5 IDE for the brainfuck language
4. `bf.js` runs scripts in bf.

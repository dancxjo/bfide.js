genetic-bf
========

Includes an HTML5 IDE for the brainfuck language

I really enjoy [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brainfuck). I'm looking forward to doing some genetic programming with it. (It simulates DNA pretty well considering its very small lexicon of 8 symbols.)

*`bf.php` runs a specified bf program with the provided input and produces a JSON description of its output, the time and number of steps it took to run the program
*`flower.js` describes a function to produce random input and the desired output of a bf program, as well as a fitness test to rank candidates
